This is the manufactured board without the components on it. I took this, solder paste and a aluminuim stencil and assembled the components on the board. I then put it in our toaster over and turned it up to full heat until all of the paste turned silver and metalic meaning that the connection was bridged.

This is a screenshot of the PCB design from KiCad which is a free open source pcb design software. I formatted this and sent it off to JLC PCB and they sent me the boards which are shown above.

This is a picture of the final product. I used SMD soldering to attach all the components. It has been flashed with QMK and works perfectly. I also designed a case that I am gonna have 3d printed once we finish building our 3d printer(will attach pictures with case after).
